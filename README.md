# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

This website is a work scheduler. If the user wants to input events that they want to do during work hours, they would type in whatever event they are planning or have already done in the correct time slot, then hit the save button. My motivation for this project comes from the fact that sometimes I can get off track, and not complete the work that I have to do in the correct time frame, so this application could really help someone like myself. I built this project so others like myself can focus and plan out their time better. This was the first project that utilized third-party APIs as well as the library Dayjs. The events are kept even when the user leaves the page and comes back, so that if they plan out their work day and forget about it, they can still come back to it if need be.
